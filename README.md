# RiverConflation
A python based tool for spatially conflating 2 GIS river networks

DISCLAIMER
This tool is under development and is considered a pre alpha-release.

## Description
See the code

## Developing
I am developing RiverConflation using using ipython notebook started with the --script command included. This gives a .py copy of each notebook so they can be easily imported.

All editing should be in the ipynb files as the .py files are overwritten automatically.

## Requirements
At this stage this is simpily an Ipython notebook developed an minimally tested with python 2.7 (Anaconda 64bit on windows).

See the imports in the code for a full list of modules required.

Memory and CPU time requirements can be significant for large river networks.
